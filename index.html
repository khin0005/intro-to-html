        <p>Hello! This is Moh Moh Khine, but my friends call me <em>Moh Moh</em>. I am from Myanmar, which is situated in Southeast Asia.Currently, I am attending the IMD course at Algonquin College. I have two female cats, which are Mia and Zara. However, Mia and Zara do not get along with each other.</p>
        <p>
            I like creative design and storytelling. Outside of school, I love exploring photography, especially macro photography. I'm also passionate about sharing positive energy with others and always curious to learn about different cultures and ideas.
